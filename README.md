# MIPS-Assembly
First project using MIPS; ICS51 Lab 1
Part 1: Given a 32-bit integer the number of bits are counted
Part 2: Given a 32-bit integer, bits are swapped with its adjacent bit. 
Part 3: Given three integers, finds the smallest one and the largest one then multiplies their sum by two and returns it.
